# Treeforj

An ASCII tree diagram and structure generator. Designed and tested for AI readability. 

## Input Methods

Create directory trees in two ways:

1. Regular Tree Format:

   Use indentation with two spaces per pathway; slashes are optional.

   ```
   Root/
     File1.txt
     Folder1/
       File2.md
       File3.html
   ```

2. Markdown Format:

   Paste or type a markdown outline; use headers and lists.

   ```
   # Root
   - File1.txt
   ## Folder1
   - File2.md
   - File3.html
   ```

### Comments & Metadata

Add comments to any folder or file using `#`. Comments will be auto-aligned in the final diagram. Each comment will be preserved during export as separate `..._comments.txt` files within the folder they belong:

```
Root/           # Main project folder
  src/          # Source code
    index.js    # Entry point
  README.md     # Documentation
```

## Theme Settings

- **Dark Mode:** Switch between light and dark themes for better visibility.
- **Preserve Ordering:** Should your folders and/or files have numbering or lettering as part of their outline, this toggle will preserve that list structure (e.g., "1. File.txt" or "a. File.txt").
- **Trailing Slash:** Toggle the trailing slash `/` after folder names.
- **Connected Roots:** Toggle the vertical pathway connecting the root folders.

## Display Settings

- **Folder Icons:** Show üìÅ before folder names (non-ASCII emoji).
- **File Icons:** Show üìÑ before file names (non-ASCII emoji).
- **All Caps:** Convert all names to uppercase.

## Format Settings

**Replace Spaces:** Choose how to handle spaces in file and folder names.

- **None:** Keep spaces as is (e.g., "my file.txt").
- **Underscore:** Replace spaces with the underscore `_` (e.g., "my_file.txt").
- **Dash:** Replace spaces with the dash `-` (e.g., "my-file.txt").
- **Remove:** Remove all white spaces (e.g., "myfile.txt").

**Export Format:** Choose how files are exported:

- **Text:** Export all files as text `.txt` files (default).
- **HTML:** Export all files as web `.html` files.
- **Markdown:** Export all files as markdown `.md` files.
- **Keep Original:** Preserve existing extensions; else `.txt` without extensions.

## Markdown Features
